➡️ See the page or frame titled “Final Wireframe” for the finalized design.  

- **Real-time Internal Monitoring**: Provides immediate visibility into integration health before issues impact members.

- **Automatic Problem Detection**: Health checks automatically detect problems through monitoring.

- **API Endpoint Monitoring**: Monitors FN's actual API endpoints and tracks response times.

- **Integration-Specific**: Customized to FN's specific integrations and error patterns.

## 🔧 Configuration

### Required Environment Variables
```bash
# Sentry Configuration
SENTRY_ORGANIZATION_SLUG=your_sentry_organization_slug
SENTRY_PROJECT_ID=your_sentry_project_id
SENTRY_BEARER_AUTH=your_sentry_bearer_token

# Mailgun Configuration
MAILGUN_API_NAME=your_mailgun_api_name
MAILGUN_API_KEY=your_mailgun_api_key
```

### Getting Credentials
- **Sentry**: Organization slug, project ID, and API token from Sentry settings
- **Mailgun**: Domain name and API key from Mailgun dashboard

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Environment Variable Errors**: Ensure `.env` file exists and contains all required variables
- **API Connection Issues**: Verify credentials and network connectivity
- **Docker Issues**: Check container logs with `docker logs backend` or with docker desktop

For detailed troubleshooting, see the [Troubleshooting section](./DOCUMENTATION.md#troubleshooting) in the full documentation.

## 🔮 Future Plans

- Additional integrations (HubSpot, Stripe, AWS)
- Advanced analytics and predictive alerts
- Mobile application
- Custom dashboards and alert rules

See the [Future Expansion section](./DOCUMENTATION.md#future-expansion) for detailed roadmap.
